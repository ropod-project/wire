            # velocity motion model with (ii) a fixed state with fixed uncertainty.
          
            # After position updates, the position is represented by the Kalman filter estimate, during propagation, 
            # the 'trust' shifts towards the uniform distribution, which represents the 'object lost' hypothesis. The rate 
            # of the transitioning from Kalman filter to 'object lost' depends on the process noise of the Kalman filter, 
            # which is set by means of the max_acceleration parameter. The higher the maximum acceleration, the faster the 
            # uncertainty increase during propagation and the lower the 'trust' in the motion model. In case custom models
            # are preferred, this is possible (see the source code for examples).
